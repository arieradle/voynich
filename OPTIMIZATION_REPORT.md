## 🎯 Key Insights

### What Worked Best

1. **Word Family Expansion** 🌟
   - Adding systematic families (al-, or-, ar-, etc.) gave massive returns
   - Each base morpheme enabled 10-15 compounds to resolve
   - Most efficient strategy by far

2. **High-Frequency Targeting** 🎯
   - Words appearing 15-22x across dataset had huge impact
   - Single-letter function words (`d`, `r`, `y`, `s`) critical
   - Short connectors (`or`, `al`, `od`) essential

3. **Polysemy Implementation** 🔄
   - Context-aware meanings improved accuracy
   - 10 polysemous words × 3 meanings = 30 effective vocabulary entries
   - Base meanings provide fallback for all contexts

4. **Systematic Approach** 📊
   - Gap analysis → prioritization → addition → validation
   - Data-driven decisions beat guessing
   - Iterative refinement compounds improvements

### What Didn't Work As Expected

1. **Some Pre-Added Words Not Resolving**
   - Words like "o", "otcho", "ydain" still showing as unknown
   - Possible duplicate entries or parsing issues
   - Need to investigate dictionary structure

2. **Herbal A Harder Than Herbal B**
   - Different dialect or scribe style
   - More unique vocabulary
   - Lower baseline quality

3. **Diminishing Returns at High Coverage**
   - Getting from 50% → 60% easier than 60% → 70%
   - Long/complex compounds harder to match
   - Rare words have minimal impact
