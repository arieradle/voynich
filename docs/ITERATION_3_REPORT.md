## 📋 Iteration Strategy

### **Optimization from Iteration 2:**
1. ✅ **Increased batch size:** 10 words → 12 words (+20%)
2. ✅ **qo- prefix focus:** 6 qo- intensifier words (proven reliable pattern)
3. ✅ **Maintained quality:** Avg confidence 0.73 (above threshold)

## 🎯 Analysis & Insights

### **What Worked Exceptionally Well:**

1. **qo- Prefix Pattern** ⭐⭐
   - 6 qo- intensifier words added with consistent 0.75 confidence
   - Highly reliable morphological pattern
   - Provided bulk of Iteration 3's vocabulary additions
   - Validates pattern-family approach for future iterations

2. **Herbal B milestone achievement**
   - Reached 70.2% coverage (exceeding 70% target)
   - Started at 68.0%, gained +2.2% across 3 iterations
   - Only 193 unknowns remaining in Herbal B

3. **Larger batch size maintained quality**
   - 12 words added (20% more than Iteration 2)
   - Average confidence 0.73 remained above threshold
   - Demonstrates scalability of methodology

4. **Diversified morphological patterns**
   - Successfully mixed cross-section (1), directional (2), and intensifier (6) words
   - Shows flexibility in candidate selection when cross-section pool is exhausted

### **Challenges & Observations:**

1. **Limited cross-section availability**
   - Only 1 new cross-section candidate found (chokchy)
   - Most cross-section words (5 total) were added in Iterations 1-2
   - Suggests cross-section pool for herbal sections is largely tapped

2. **Coverage gain remained consistent at +0.6%**
   - Despite 12 words vs 10 (Iteration 2), gain was same
   - Indicates diminishing returns per word added
   - May need to target lower-frequency words or new word families

3. **Herbal A progress slower than Herbal B**
   - Herbal A: +0.6% (55.2% total)
   - Herbal B: +0.6% (70.2% total)
   - 15% coverage gap between sections
   - Herbal A may have more transcription issues or unique vocabulary

4. **qo- pattern dominance**
   - 50% of additions (6/12) were qo- prefix words
   - Shows both success of pattern and potential over-reliance
   - Future iterations may need to diversify morphological families

### **Pattern Family Success:**

The **qo- intensifier pattern** proved to be the breakthrough of Iteration 3:
- All 6 qo- words had identical confidence (0.75)
- Morphologically consistent and predictable
- Validates the "pattern family" approach: identifying reliable morphological patterns and systematically adding related words
- Suggests similar approach for other prefix families (sh-, ch-, ot-, etc.)

## 🔄 Iteration 4 Recommendations

### **Immediate Priorities:**

1. **Reach 60% overall coverage** - Only **0.7%** away! (59.3% → 60.0%)
2. **Target Herbal A improvement** - Focus on slower-progressing section
3. **Explore new morphological families** - sh- prefix, ch- compounds, -ain/-edy suffixes
4. **Target 10-12 words** - Maintain current batch size

### **High-Priority Candidates for Iteration 4:**

Based on remaining unknowns and pattern analysis:
- **sh- prefix family** - Location markers (hic-based)
- **ch- compound family** - Botanical actions
- **-ain suffix words** - Past state markers (similar to -aiin)
- **Medium-frequency (8-12x)** - Balance between reliability and availability

### **Strategy Refinements:**

1. **Pattern family batches** - Add 4-6 words from same morphological family
2. **Herbal A focus** - Specifically target words appearing frequently in Herbal A
3. **Lower frequency tolerance** - Consider words with 7-9 occurrences if high confidence
4. **Compound decomposition** - Use compound_decomposer more aggressively

### **Estimated Iteration 4 Impact:**
- If 10-12 words added: +0.6-0.8% coverage (reaching 60% milestone ✅)
- If Herbal A focused: Could gain +0.8-1.0% in that section
- Projected coverage after Iteration 4: **~60%** (milestone!)
