## 🎯 Analysis & Insights

### **What Worked Exceptionally Well:**

1. **Cross-section prioritization** ⭐
   - 4 words appearing in both sections provided strong validation
   - These words showed consistent usage patterns across different contexts
   - Reliability indicator for future iterations

2. **Larger batch size**
   - 10 words provided better coverage-to-effort ratio
   - Maintained quality (avg confidence 0.76)
   - More efficient than small batches

3. **Herbal B breakthrough**
   - +1.4% improvement (best section result yet)
   - Cross-section words particularly effective in Herbal B
   - Approaching 70% coverage target

4. **Suffix pattern focus**
   - -ody suffix words (movement verbs) highly reliable
   - -aiin suffix continues to perform well
   - Pattern-based selection proven effective

### **Challenges & Observations:**

1. **Coverage gain still below 3% target**
   - 0.8% vs 3% target suggests need for even larger batches
   - Many unknowns are still transcription artifacts
   - Diminishing returns from high-frequency words

2. **Herbal A slower progress**
   - Only +0.6% vs Herbal B's +1.4%
   - More transcription issues in Herbal A folios
   - May need folio-specific investigation

3. **Confidence threshold trade-off**
   - Lowering to 0.70 allowed more words (good)
   - Average confidence dropped from 0.79 to 0.76 (acceptable)
   - Still well above minimum threshold

### **Cross-Section Validation Success:**

The 4 cross-section words proved the hypothesis that words appearing in multiple sections are more reliable:
- All 4 resolved occurrences successfully
- No conflicts or translation issues
- Strong evidence for prioritizing cross-section candidates

## 🔄 Iteration 3 Recommendations

### **Immediate Priorities:**

1. **Target 12-15 words** - Continue scaling batch size
2. **Investigate folio f001r** - Address transcription artifact issue
3. **Focus on cross-section candidates** - Proven reliability
4. **Target Herbal A improvement** - Close gap with Herbal B

### **High-Priority Candidates for Iteration 3:**

Based on remaining unknowns (frequency 10-14, cross-section potential):
- Words appearing in multiple sections (highest priority)
- -ain suffix words (similar to -aiin, -ody proven patterns)
- Compound words with known roots
- Medium-frequency (8-12x) to avoid artifacts

### **Strategy Refinements:**

1. **Multi-section requirement:** Strongly prioritize words in 2+ sections
2. **Pattern families:** Add related words in groups (all y- directional words)
3. **Visual validation:** Cross-reference botanical terms with illustrations
4. **Folio investigation:** Dedicate time to understanding f001r transcription

### **Estimated Iteration 3 Impact:**
- If 12-15 words added with similar pattern: +1.0-1.5% coverage
- If focusing on cross-section words: +1.2-1.8% coverage (higher quality)
- Projected coverage after Iteration 3: ~60%
