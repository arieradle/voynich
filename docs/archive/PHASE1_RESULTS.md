| Word | Frequency | Suggested Latin | Analysis |
|------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| `choo` | 16x | valde facit | cho doubled = intensified action |
| `ckhyd` | 16x | inspicit parv | ckhy + d = examines small |

---

## 🚀 Recommendations for Phase 2

### Immediate Actions (1-2 hours)
1. **Investigate comma artifacts** in parsing
   - Words like "chy,tol" and "cphodal,es" suggest delimiter issues
   - May need to enhance word cleaning in download_folios.py
   - Could unlock additional improvements

2. **Add next 10 high-frequency words**
   - Focus on words appearing 13x+
   - Prioritize simple compounds (choo, ckhyd, etc.)
   - Expected impact: +0.5-1.0% coverage

3. **Validate translations**
   - Review folios with biggest gains (f004r, f015v)
   - Check if translations make more botanical sense
   - Ensure Latin words fit visual context

### Strategic Next Steps
1. **Build morphological decomposer** (Phase 3)
   - Auto-detect compound words
   - Generate translations from components
   - Expected impact: +10-15% coverage

2. **Section-specific vocabulary** (Phase 4)
   - Identify Herbal A vs Herbal B unique words
   - Add targeted vocabulary for lower-performing section
   - May reveal different scribal patterns

3. **Visual validation** (Phase 5)
   - Cross-reference with folio images
   - Validate botanical terms against illustrations
   - Improve confidence scores

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Technical
1. **Python cache matters** - Had to clear `__pycache__` for dictionary updates to take effect
2. **Word frequency is king** - 9 words covered 175 instances (excellent ROI)
3. **Section variations exist** - Herbal B responded better to same words
4. **Parsing quality critical** - Comma artifacts suggest room for improvement

### Process
1. **Test one folio first** - Caught the cache issue early with f014r
2. **Measure everything** - Per-folio metrics show true impact
3. **Iterate quickly** - Small batches (9 words) easier to validate
4. **Document reasoning** - Notes in YAML help future decisions

### Domain
1. **Compound words dominate** - Most unknowns are known roots combined
2. **qo- prefix highly productive** - Added 3, all high-frequency
3. **Motion verbs common** - yty (transit), qoy (toward), etc.
4. **Botanical terms consistent** - kokaiin (ripens), charod (variation)
