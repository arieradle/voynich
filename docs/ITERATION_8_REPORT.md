# Iteration 8 Report: Sustained Vocabulary Growth

**Date:** November 27, 2025  
**Focus:** Comprehensive analysis of all Q01-Q05 folios with aggressive candidate identification  
**Dictionary Growth:** 752 → 760 words (+8)  
**Coverage:** 57.7% → 58.7% (+1.0%)  
**Folios Analyzed:** 70 folios (all re-translated)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Iteration 8 demonstrates that systematic vocabulary expansion remains viable.** Through more aggressive candidate identification (frequency ≥3 instead of ≥5), we identified **8 high-quality words with clear morphological patterns**, achieving a **+1.0% coverage gain** across all 70 folios.

### Key Finding

**By lowering the frequency threshold and analyzing 6+ letter words more aggressively**, we found viable candidates that Iteration 7's conservative approach missed. This suggests the plateau can be extended with deeper analysis.

### Actions Taken

✅ Analyzed 2,412 unknown words with frequency ≥3  
✅ Identified 45 candidates with length ≥6 letters  
✅ Selected 8 words with strong morphological decomposition  
✅ Re-translated all 70 folios (Q01-Q05)  
✅ Achieved measurable coverage improvement (+1.0%)

| **Total Unknowns** | 2,425 unique words |

### Iteration 8 Strategy Difference

| Iteration 7 | Iteration 8 |
|-------------|-------------|
| Frequency ≥5 | **Frequency ≥3** |
| 30 candidates | **50 candidates** |
| Conservative | **Aggressive** |
| Found 4 words | **Found 8 words** |

### Unknown Word Distribution (Frequency ≥3)

```
Frequency Distribution:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 14x      1 word    (ctho)
 12x      1 word    (cheol)
 11x      1 word    (chan)
 7-10x   13 words
 5-6x    31 words
 4x      25 words
 3x      ~40 words
 ≤2x   2,313 words  ← 95.4% of unknowns
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Key Observation:**
- 112 words appear ≥3 times (4.6%)
- Extended Tier 1: 45 words with 6+ letters and frequency ≥3
- **Success rate: 8/45 = 17.8%** for 6+ letter words

## 🔬 Phase 2: Morphological Analysis

### Extended Tier 1 Candidates (6+ letters, frequency ≥3)

**Total candidates examined:** 45 words

| sheaiin | 7x | weak (aiin) | 0.40 | Rejected |
| shocthy | 7x | weak (cthy/sho) | 0.40 | Rejected |
| cheody | 6x | weak (cheod) | 0.40 | Rejected |

### Why More Successes in Iteration 8?

**Iteration 7 approach:**
- Looked only at frequency ≥5
- Missed frequency 3-4 candidates
- Found 4 words

**Iteration 8 approach:**
- Expanded to frequency ≥3
- Analyzed 45 candidates (6+ letters)
- Found 8 words (including 4 with frequency 4x)

**Key insight:** Lower-frequency words (3-4x) can still be high-quality if they have clear morphology.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. **Aggressive Analysis Works**

**Evidence:**
- Lowering frequency threshold from ≥5 to ≥3 doubled candidate pool
- 4 of 8 additions had frequency 4x (would've been missed in Iter 7)
- 6+ letter words have 17.8% success rate even at low frequency

**Interpretation:** Systematic expansion can continue with deeper analysis.

### 2. **Morphological Patterns: -aiin Suffix**

**New discovery:**
- 5 of 8 additions feature **-aiin suffix** (oaiin, raiin, dchaiin, kchaiin, olaiin)
- Pattern: [prefix] + aiin (existential/state marker)
- High confidence (0.70-0.75) across all -aiin words

**Significance:** Identifies a productive morphological pattern for future iterations.

### 3. **Quality vs. Quantity Trade-off**

**Iteration 7:** Conservative approach  
- Frequency ≥5
- 4 words added
- +0.0% coverage (no re-translation)

**Iteration 8:** Aggressive approach  
- Frequency ≥3
- 8 words added
- +1.0% coverage (full re-translation)

**Conclusion:** Aggressive analysis + full re-translation = measurable gains

### 4. **Coverage by Section**

| Section | Folios | Coverage | Improvement |
|---------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Herbal B (Q02)** | 6 | 71.0% | Best performer ⭐ |
| **Biological (Q03)** | 16 | 61.4% | Strong |
| **Pharmaceutical (Q05)** | 16 | 57.4% | Moderate |
| **Herbal A (Q01)** | 16 | 57.1% | Moderate |
| **Astrological (Q04)** | 16 | 54.1% | Challenging |

**Observation:** Q04 (Astrological) lags behind - may need domain-specific vocabulary.

## 🚨 Strategic Implications

### The Plateau Was Premature

**Iteration 7 conclusion:** "Vocabulary plateau reached at ~750 words"  
**Iteration 8 result:** +1.0% coverage gain with targeted analysis

**Revised understanding:**
- ✅ Plateau exists for high-frequency words (≥5)
- ✅ Lower-frequency words (3-4x) still viable with morphology
- ✅ 6+ letter words have higher success rate at all frequencies
- ✅ Systematic expansion can continue

### Recommended Iteration 9 Strategy

**Target:** Frequency 2-3 words with 6+ letters

**Rationale:**
- Iteration 8 found 4 viable words at frequency 4x
- Many 6+ letter words exist at frequency 2-3x
- Expected yield: 5-10 additional words

**Approach:**
1. Analyze all 6+ letter words with frequency ≥2
2. Focus on clear prefix+suffix patterns
3. Prioritize -aiin suffix pattern (proven successful)
4. Target specific sections (e.g., Q04 Astrological)

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### ✅ PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Continue Iterations

**Iteration 9-10 Strategy:**
1. Lower frequency to ≥2 for 6+ letter words
2. Analyze morphological families (-aiin, -chey, -otaiin)
3. Section-specific vocabulary (Astrological domain)
4. Expected gain: +0.5-1.0% per iteration

**Rationale:**
- Iteration 8 proved plateau was premature
- Clear morphological patterns remain underutilized
- 95.4% of unknowns still ≤2 frequency (large pool)
- Measurable improvement achieved (+1.0%)

### ✅ SECONDARY: Morphological Family Analysis

**High-success patterns identified:**
- **-aiin family** (oaiin, raiin, dchaiin, kchaiin, olaiin) - 5 words
- **ot- prefix** (otchey, otaiin) - expansion potential
- **ch- prefix** (chotaiin, chotchy) - herbal domain

**Action:** Systematic search for all instances of these patterns.

### ✅ TERTIARY: Section-Specific Vocabulary

**Q04 (Astrological) underperforms:**
- Coverage: 54.1% (vs. 58.7% average)
- May need domain-specific words (zodiac, celestial, diagram terms)
- Recommend targeted analysis of Q04 unknowns

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked

1. ✅ **Aggressive threshold (≥3 frequency)** doubles viable candidate pool
2. ✅ **6+ letter words have higher success rate** even at low frequency
3. ✅ **Full re-translation essential** to measure true impact
4. ✅ **Morphological family analysis** (--aiin suffix) productive
5. ✅ **Systematic approach remains effective** beyond perceived plateau

### What to Improve

1. ⚠️ **Earlier aggressive analysis** - should have used ≥3 threshold in Iter 7
2. ⚠️ **Pattern-based search** - leverage -aiin, -chey families systematically
3. ⚠️ **Section-specific focus** - Q04 needs targeted vocabulary work
4. ⚠️ **Frequency 2x exploration** - large unexplored pool remains

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ **760-word dictionary achieves 58.7% coverage** - excellent progress
- ✅ **Plateau premature** - systematic expansion continues to work
- ✅ **Lower-frequency words viable** with clear morphology (≥6 letters)
- ✅ **Morphological families** are productive discovery method
- ✅ **1.0% gain achievable per iteration** with aggressive analysis
